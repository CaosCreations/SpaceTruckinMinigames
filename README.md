# SpaceTruckinMinigames
A collection of minigames to be used in the SpaceTruckin project

### Directory structure
```
+-- Assets
|   +-- Minigame1
|	| 	+-- Materials
| 	| 	+-- Prefabs 
|	| 	+-- Scripts
| 	| 	+-- Scenes
|   +-- Minigame2
|	| 	+-- Materials
| 	| 	+-- Prefabs 
|	| 	+-- Scripts
|	|	+-- Scenes
...
```
- Each minigame will have a different folder under ```Assets/```
- Inside this folder, specific asset folders (e.g. Scripts, Scenes, ...) will be created to house assets specific to that minigame. 
- This way, they are kept separate from one another but are in the same repo so can be played alongside each other fairly easily.
